# Impact-of-Bias-Variance-tradeoff-on-model-performance-for-medical-image-analysis-
This project analyzes brain tumor classification using MRI images and studies the impact of the bias-variance tradeoff. Models of varying complexityâ€”from simple dense networks to deep CNNs like ResNet50 are evaluated, with an intermediate CNN achieving optimal accuracy and generalization.
